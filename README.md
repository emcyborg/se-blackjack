Software Engineering - Blackjack
================================

Just a git for the Blackjack project.

Easy setup:

1. Create an account on [Github](http://www.github.com) and [email me](mailto:seallred@smcm.edu) your username (so I can give you push permission)
2. Download a simple git client and set it up with your Github info
	* Github for Windows
	* Github for Mac
	* TortoiseGit is good too, but I haven't really used it
3. Open [this repository on Github](https://github.com/vermiculus/se-blackjack).
4. Select 'Clone in Windows' or 'Clone in Mac'.
	* The Github client should open up. It will download all source files into the root Github folder on your computer. This folder can be changed in settings, otherwise it just defaults to your documents folder.

Committing:

5. Make any changes you'd like in the repository folder and save them.
6. Open up your github client and commit your changes.
	* The next time anyone pulls from the repository, they will get your changes.
