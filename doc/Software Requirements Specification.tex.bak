\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

This document will record all of the requirements of Blackjack version n.0.  It will record Functional, System, Hardware, Software, Interface, and Performance requirements.

\subsection{Scope}

This document will establish the requirements we will adhere to when creating the blackjack software.  It will serve as the customer's way of understanding what they should expect.  It will also serve as our standard for what we need to do in order to satisfy the customer.  This document will serve as the basis for any Testing.  Furthermore, this document will serve as a record of things the customer had asked us to do.  If something does not appear in this document, then it should not be expected out of the final product.  However, this document does not overrule the will of the customer.  If the customer should change his mind about any of the requirements herein, this document will be modified accordingly (potentially after negotiation).
